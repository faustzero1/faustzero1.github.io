I cancel using pelican (bloat).  
Now I'm using [ssg by romanzolotarev](https://romanzolotarev.com/bin/ssg).  
I'm also` still exploring other static site generator, a simple static site generator like a'ssg' with some extensible feature would be cool right.  
Just like others maybe I end up creating my own static site generator.  

Some reference I might be use:  

1. Zola (Sass support, Syntax Highlighting, but config are writen in TOML format, Written in rust see [Rust's Trademark Concerns](https://wiki.hyperbola.info/doku.php?id=en:philosophy:rust_trademark))  
2. Pelican (AGPL 3.0 License, Writen in Python, Bloat)  
3. Hugo (Fast but also bloat, Writen in Go)  
4. 11ty???
