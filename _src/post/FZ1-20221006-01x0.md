## The Hall of Mirrors Lyrics

```
[Verse 1]
The young man stepped into the hall of mirrors
Where he discovered a reflection of himself

[Hook 1]
Even the greatest stars
Discover themselves in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars
Discover themselves in the looking glass


[Verse 2]
Sometimes he saw his real face
And sometimes a stranger at his place

[Hook 2]
Even the greatest stars
Find their face in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars
Find their face in the looking glass


[Verse 3]
He fell in love with the image of himself
And suddenly the picture was distorted

[Hook 3]
Even the greatest stars
Dislike themselves in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars
Dislike themselves in the looking glass


[Verse 4]
He made up the person he wanted to be
And changed into a new personality

[Hook 4]
Even the greatest stars
Change themselves in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars
Change themselves in the looking glass


[Verse 5]
The artist is living in the mirror
With the echoes of himself

[Hook 5]
Even the greatest stars
Live their lives in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars
Live their lives in the looking glass

[Hook 6]
Even the greatest stars
Fix their face in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars
Fix their face in the looking glass

[Hook 5]
Even the greatest stars
Live their lives in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars
Live their lives in the looking glass
```
