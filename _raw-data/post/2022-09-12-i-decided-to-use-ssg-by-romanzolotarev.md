**ssg** is a simple static site generator written in POSIX shell. <br>
Created by romanzolotarev.

How it works is just like a sandwich, there is:

1. "_header.html" file 			=> Top part of the sandwich
2. "2022-09-12-your_content.md" file 	=> Middle part of the sandwich
3. "_footer.html" file 			=> Bottom part of the sandwich
