## About me

I am an Engineer Student & also a Developer who try to involve in User Experience. <br>
Additionally, I rather call myself a "Voyager" rather than a "Hacker", a man who try to explore the "sub-way" of this world.

I Love Art, Technology, and Efficiency. <br>
I am Also Still Learning.

## About this website

This is my first webpage, write in plain HTML <br>
This website are originally hosted at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) using Codeberg pages (similar feature like github pages or gitlab pages). <br>
Please visit the [Origin Version](https://faustzero1.codeberg.page) for the latest update of this website.

I do a lot of my effort to make this website *small* (in Computing Unit) but also *reliable*. <br>
This website are static website under HTML with only few styling that apply **UX First**. <br>

* No nonsense JavaScript. <br>
* No nonsense CDN. <br>
* No nonsense **Framework** <br>
* Just pure HTML which mostly is only less than 9Kb <br>

The styling part are attached under the ```<head>``` tags, which make this website keep on its style by just only .html <br>

* Simply try save any pages in this website as html, <br> 
* Open it offline on your machine, <br>
* The result will be the same as you view on online session (maybe except for the future asset, but may not often).

FYI, after I thought, I don't have plan to buying personal domain for my personal webpage. Yeah I know that "faustzero1.codeberg.page" is a long URL, But in the end my web visitors didn't really care about that. I believe they care more about what they need when visiting here. Aside from that, I can't always (Eternally) maintain of my website, maybe one day i will die alone without anyone knowing (may Allah know best).

So, having that in mind, I want to make my webpage as my legacy, Sharing my knowledge through some of my posts (Writings/Videos/Pictures/Documents/Archives/etc), that I hope it will valuable for you (yes you, my dear visitor).

Plus, If I can deliver really good content using Codeberg as domain it will encourage my visitors to use and also involving in Codeberg, Which Codeberg are a great ethical host & forge platform that I think people should use this.
