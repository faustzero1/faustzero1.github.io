## Why

Because using "Smartphone" is sucks and bloat so much, if you have $100-$150 just buy a Laptop that's it ThinkPad X230 or T430.  
There is no "Android Emulator" available yet.  
We need to be a fulltime sickkunt, that isn't a slave of a #BIGTECH locked things.  
We're All Gonna Fuarking Make It Brah!
