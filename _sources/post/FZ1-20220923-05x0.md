## Torn in Two Lyrics

```
[Verse 1]
Is this the way it's got to be?
Ignite the fire inside of me
Embrace the life of tragedy
A tide of war and broken dreams

[Chorus]
I am torn in two
Hold on, hold on
We're barely alive
I am faded through
Hold on, hold on
The fallen arise
I will fight this war for you
And let the dawn of love survive
Broken, I crawl back to life

[Verse 2]
Is this the fate we fall between?
Deface the life inside of me
Drain the heart of atrophy
And take away the remedy

[Chorus]
I am torn in two
Hold on, hold on
We're barely alive
I am faded through
Hold on, hold on
The fallen arise
I will fight this war for you
And let the dawn of love survive
Broken, I crawl back to life

[Chorus]
I am torn in two (Please hold on)
Hold on, hold on
We're barely alive
I am faded through (Please hold on)
Hold on, hold on
The fallen arise
I will fight this war for you (Please hold on)
And let the dawn of love survive
Broken, I crawl back to life

[Outro]
Hold on
Rise
Hold on
Rise
Hold on
Rise
Hold on
```
