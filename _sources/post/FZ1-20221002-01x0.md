## Why

As I say before, I don't have plan to buy domain.   
Then I change #SelfDevelopment  
Getting a personal domain will gain your more Authority and also SEO of your website.  
And I need that, however the hosting are still on codeberg and I always give the Credit for that (Hosted on Codeberg).  

## fz1.space

Alhamdullilah I get this domain pretty cheap.  
It's the cheapest but also the most the most appealing I get from niagahoster / namecheap.  

```
15ribu udah dapet domain murmer + URL pendek njir.
