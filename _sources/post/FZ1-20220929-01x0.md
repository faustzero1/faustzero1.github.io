## Breath Lyrics

```
[Verse 1]
I see nothing in your eyes
And the more I see, the less I like
Is it over yet?
In my head
I know nothing of your kind
And I won't reveal your evil mind
Is it over yet?
I can't win

[Pre-Chorus]
So, sacrifice yourself
And let me have what's left
I know that I can find
The fire in your eyes
I'm going all the way
Get away, please

[Chorus]
You take the breath right out of me
You left a hole where my heart should be
You got to fight just to make it through
'Cause I will be the death of you

[Verse 2]
This will be all over soon (This will all be over soon)
Pour the salt into the open wound
Is it over yet?
Let me in

[Pre-Chorus]
So, sacrifice yourself
And let me have what's left
I know that I can find
The fire in your eyes
I'm going all the way
Get away, please

[Chorus]
You take the breath right out of me
You left a hole where my heart should be
You got to fight just to make it through
'Cause I will be the death of you

[Bridge]
(Take, take, take)
I'm waiting
I'm praying
Realize
Start hating

[Chorus]
You take the breath right out of me
You left a hole where my heart should be
You got to fight just to make it through
'Cause I will be the death of you
```
