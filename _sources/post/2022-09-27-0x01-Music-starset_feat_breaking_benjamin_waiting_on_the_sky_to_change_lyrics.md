## Waiting On The Sky To Change Lyrics

```
[Verse 1: Dustin Bates]
There's something in the air
Burning ions in the oxygen are all aglow
A feeling everywhere
Premonitions of the storm that comes
But I won't go

[Pre-Chorus: Dustin Bates]
I'm done running towards
The eyes of tornadoes
Pretending this is home

[Chorus: Dustin Bates]
I breathe in the atmosphere
Let it wash over my fear
Of these heights as I transcend
And become whole again
I breathe in the atmosphere
Lеt it take me out of herе
I won't live life in the rain
Waiting on the sky to change
(Waiting on the sky to change)

[Verse 2: Benjamin Burnley]
I've been frozen since that day
I saw my clear blue skies
As they turned to gray in front of me
It's hard to find my way
Can I rise above
When giving up is all I know?

[Pre-Chorus: Benjamin Burnley]
I'm done running towards
The eyes of tornadoes
Pretending this is hope

[Chorus: Benjamin Burnley]
I breathe in the atmosphere
Let it wash over my fear
Of these heights as I transcend
And become whole again
I breathe in the atmosphere
Let it take me out of here
I won't live life in the rain
Waiting on the sky to change

[Bridge: Benjamin Burnley, Dustin Bates]
(And the water's rising)
(And the water's rising)
And the water's rising
Going deaf from the sound of rain
And the water's rising
I won't drown in the flood you made
And the water's rising
Going deaf from the sound of rain
And the water's ri-i-i-ising
I won't drown in the flood you made

[Chorus: Dustin Bates, Benjamin Burnley, both]
I breathe in the atmosphere
Let it wash over my fear
Of these heights as I transcend
And become whole again
I breathe in the atmosphere
Let it wash over my fear
Of these heights as I transcend
And become whole again
I breathe in the atmosphere
Let it take me out of here
I won't live life in the rain
Waiting on the sky to change

[Outro: Dustin Bates, Benjamin Burnley]
Waiting on the sky to change
Waiting on the sky to change
Waiting on the sky to change
Waiting on the sky to change
```
