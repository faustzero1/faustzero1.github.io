## Blow Me Away Lyrics

```
[Verse 1]
They fall in line, one at a time, ready to play
(I can't see them anyway)
No time to lose, we've got to move, steady your helm
(I am losing sight again)

[Pre-Chorus]
Fire your guns, it's time to run, blow me away
(I will stay in the mess I made)
After the fall, we'll shake it off, show me the way

[Chorus]
Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven when we die
I am a shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all

[Verse 2]
There's nothin' left, so save your breath, lying in wait
(Caught inside this tidal wave)
Your cover's blown, nowhere to go, holding your fate
(Lonely, I will walk alone)

[Pre-Chorus]
Fire your guns, it's time to run, blow me away
(I will stay in the mess I made)
After the fall, we'll shake it off, show me the way

[Chorus]
Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven when we die
I am a shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all

[Bridge: Ben]
You wanted it back
Don't fight me now
Here it comes
Die

[Chorus]
Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven when we die
I am a shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all
Save us all
```
