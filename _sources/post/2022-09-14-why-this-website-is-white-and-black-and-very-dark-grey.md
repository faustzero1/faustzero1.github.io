# Why this website is White and Black and Very Dark Grey

Date published: 2022-09-14

---

## The only color use on this website  

* #FFF - aka White  
* #000 - aka Black  
* #111 - aka Very Dark Grey  

## Why

### UX purpose

* Black and White are contrast, the color that just work.  
* Easy to use, just flip the color to make it contrast.  
* Accessibility, I know there's so many people out there who use display monitor that doesn't have (near) perfect color accuracy, however black and white contrast can still just work on those.  

### My personal color livery

* F - Faust
* 0 - Zero
* 1 - One
