Date Published: 2022-09-15

## ProTips:

Don't buy anything OTHER THAN IBM/LENOVO ThinkPad T, X, and W/P Series if you want the Real Business Experienceâ„¢.  
Some notes:
* ThinkPad originally was from IBM but bought by Lenovo
* Earlier Lenovo ThinkPad Gen still use the IBM style design, but after XX30 series they are not use it anymore (which received some flaw especially for those who know Old ThinkPad are always better in Build Quality)

## Why ThinkPad?

* Used machines are plentiful and cheap
* Excellent keyboards, tactile feel and quiet
* Great durability: magnesium roll cage for structural integrity, with high quality plastic body panels
* Utilitarian design: e.g. indicator LEDs, 7 row keyboard layout on older models
* Docking stations that easily turns your laptop into a desktop
* Easy to repair (most models), upgrade & maintain thanks to readily available service manuals for every model, spare parts easy & cheap to obtain
* Excellent Linux & *BSD support

## General recommendation:

### XX00 Series (X200 / T400 )  

* Libreboot Support.  
* 7 Row Classic Keyboard.  
* 16:10 Aspect Ratio.  
* SATA 2 Speed.

* SATA 3 Speed.     
* 64Bit 2 Core 4 Thread Intel Core I Gen 2 CPU.  

### XX30 Series (X230 / T430 / T530 / W530) [My Personal Recommendation]

* Coreboot Support (can be flashed without external hardware aka software based, see [1vyrain](https://1vyra.in/).  
* Modern ThinkPad Keyboard (can be swapped with XX20 series 7 Row Classic Keyboard).  
* 16:9 Screen Aspect Ratio.
* SATA 3 Speed.

* X61 is similar as X60, but now with 64Bit CPU.  
* unlike T60, T61 only has 16:10 Screen.
