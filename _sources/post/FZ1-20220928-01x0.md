## The Still Rages Within Lyrics

```
Looking down on the cars on the highway
The stream of tail lights

Everybody advancing together
Do so willingly sacrifice rights

When people accept they’re cogs in the system
Give up free will, conform

Individual pieces of dust swirl together
Become a full storm
Looking down on the burgeoning city
The skyscrapers rise

Even men with the greatest intentions
Start believing their own lies

We can borrow from the future
But eventually someone’s got to pay

The only way out of the cycle
Is to strike out and pave your own way
Yeah

We all fight our own fight
Will you fuel the desire to win

Always struggling with the truth
Of the life that might have been

But no matter how jagged your path is
You’ll always come back to the road

When the dust of battle settles
The war still rages within
```
