# About

## I AM and all of me

### I AM

 #RealLifeGamer #FullTimeSickunt #SoldierWithoutBorder

### Past

At some point in my live I somewhat lost contact to my fellow gamer <s>Friend's</s> Brother's,. 

```
The years went by
And we lost sight
Of the guys back then
We used to rule the night

And still I never will forget
Or will regret
Those times that we had

We were the kings of night
As we stood side by side
We used to rock the place until the early light

I remember how we sang along
To every song
Those times, they are gone

But still, I feel
I miss those days
We spent together
Yeah-yeah

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
And be there once again
And in my head I see the pictures
Of how we used to be

So one thing will remain
'Cause I still love the memories of those days...
```

### Now

Thanks for tragic history that is drive me further to get serious enough about my life.

#### Other life

I am an Engineer Student & also a Developer who try to involve in User Experience.  
Additionally, I rather call myself a "Voyager" rather than a "Hacker", a man who try to explore the "sub-way" of this world.

I Love Art, Technology, and Efficiency.  
I am Also Still Learning.  
Everything I got is cause by God Train and 'Focus'.


## About this website

This is my first webpage, write in plain HTML  
This website are originally hosted at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) using Codeberg pages (similar feature like github pages or gitlab pages). <br>
Please visit the [Origin Version](https://faustzero1.codeberg.page) for the latest update of this website.  

I do a lot of my effort to make this website *small* (in Computing Unit) but also *reliable*.  
This website are static website under HTML with only few styling that apply **UX First**.  

* No nonsense JavaScript.  
* No nonsense CDN.  
* No nonsense **Framework**.  
* Just pure HTML which mostly is only less than 30Kb.  

The styling part are attached under the ```<head>``` tags, which make this website keep on its style by just only .html  

* Save this any page as html | ```CTRL + S``` in most browser  
* Open on your local machine | the result will be the same you open it online  
* Enjoy  

FYI, after I thought, I don't have plan to buying personal domain for my personal webpage. Yeah I know that "faustzero1.codeberg.page" is a long URL, But in the end my web visitors didn't really care about that. I believe they care more about what they need when visiting here. Aside from that, I can't always (Eternally) maintain of my website, maybe one day i will die alone without anyone knowing (may Allah know best).

So, having that in mind, I want to make my webpage as my legacy, Sharing my knowledge through some of my posts (Writings/Videos/Pictures/Documents/Archives/etc), that I hope it will valuable for you (yes you, my dear visitor).

Plus, If I can deliver really good content using Codeberg as domain it will encourage my visitors to use and also involving in Codeberg, Which Codeberg are a great ethical host & forge platform that I think people should use this.
