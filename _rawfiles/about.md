# About

## About me

I am an Engineer Student & also a Developer who try to involve in User Experience.  
Additionally, I rather call myself a "Voyager" rather than a "Hacker", a man who try to explore the "sub-way" of this world.

I Love Art, Technology, and Efficiency.  
I am Also Still Learning.  

## About this website

This is my first webpage, write in plain HTML  
This website are originally hosted at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) using Codeberg pages (similar feature like github pages or gitlab pages). <br>
Please visit the [Origin Version](https://faustzero1.codeberg.page) for the latest update of this website.  

I do a lot of my effort to make this website *small* (in Computing Unit) but also *reliable*.  
This website are static website under HTML with only few styling that apply **UX First**.  

* No nonsense JavaScript.  
* No nonsense CDN.  
* No nonsense **Framework**.  
* Just pure HTML which mostly is only less than 30Kb.  

The styling part are attached under the ```<head>``` tags, which make this website keep on its style by just only .html  

* Save this any page as html | ```CTRL + Shift + S``` in most browser  
* Open on your local machine | the result will be the same you open it online  
* Enjoy  

FYI, after I thought, I don't have plan to buying personal domain for my personal webpage. Yeah I know that "faustzero1.codeberg.page" is a long URL, But in the end my web visitors didn't really care about that. I believe they care more about what they need when visiting here. Aside from that, I can't always (Eternally) maintain of my website, maybe one day i will die alone without anyone knowing (may Allah know best).

So, having that in mind, I want to make my webpage as my legacy, Sharing my knowledge through some of my posts (Writings/Videos/Pictures/Documents/Archives/etc), that I hope it will valuable for you (yes you, my dear visitor).

Plus, If I can deliver really good content using Codeberg as domain it will encourage my visitors to use and also involving in Codeberg, Which Codeberg are a great ethical host & forge platform that I think people should use this.
