<p>Learn how to really cook,<br/>
Because nowday most of the food out there getting more and more sucks (maybe we should make food.suckless.org kind of website).   </p>

<p>You should not just cooks by cooking instant food,<br/>
This mean manage and cooks the food from raw materials,<br/>
Experimenting with your own recipe&#8217;s,<br/>
Become the independent chef for your life,   </p>

<p>With cooking your own food, you will know what is the thing that you put inside your body,<br/>
It&#8217;s like utilizing open source code to the max that you know what your program run,<br/>
And not just trust because they say it&#8217;s a good free program&#8217;s and not harmful,<br/>
But the truth is the programs spy on you and it sucks because the &#8220;Developer&#8221; was soydev.<br/>
Same as they say &#8216;This is a good foods, you can eat it as you want&#8217;,<br/>
But the truth is that the material or the process behind is the one who take place to determine it&#8217;s quality.  </p>

<h3 id="stop-being-fuarking-weak-sadcunt">STOP BEING FUARKING WEAK SADCUNT</h3>

<p>Most people are weak.<br/>
This is a softened generation.<br/>
So if you have mental toughtness.<br/>
any abilities, you have any fractions of self discipline.<br/>
the ability to not want to do it but still do it.<br/>
If you can get through to doing things that you hate to do on the other side is greatness.<br/>
*Speeches by David Goggins.  </p>

<h3 id="become-the-voyager">Become the Voyager</h3>

<p>Go to explore any place you haven&#8217;t explore.<br/>
Expand your teritory of knowledge.<br/>
Become the real life Hacker.<br/>
Don&#8217;t be that IDIOT BOTNET BUGMAN NORMIE&#8217;S slave.  </p>

<h3 id="be-a-full-time-sickkunt">Be a full-time sickkunt</h3>

<p>If you are Fuarking Shredded Sickkunt.<br/>
Then you can get away from anything brah!<br/>
You can tell some fatkunt and give some shit so people be like &#8220;Yeah, Zyzz Brah, Yeah&#8221; I don&#8217;t give a fuark man.<br/>
