    <h1>SYSTEM REBOOT: THE AWAKENING</h1>
    <p class="cm">Date: 2026-01-19 | Category: Life</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>0x01. SYSTEM HALT (2022)</h2>
    <p>
        For a long time, the screen was black. The fans were spinning, but there was no output.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2022, a critical component of my life was removed abruptly. I lost a childhood friend. It didn't happen like in the movies; there was no slow fade. It was just... sudden. A runtime error that crashed the whole session.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was stunned. Frozen. I couldn't process the permanence of it.
        That event triggered a cascade of failures. The grief wasn't loud; it was a quiet, suffocating static. I found myself staring at the ceiling for hours, then days, then years. 
        I watched the seasons change through my window, but I remained stuck in the same loop. The world kept rendering new frames, everyone kept leveling up, but I was paused.
    </p>

    <h2>0x02. MISSING ARCHITECT</h2>
    <p>
        In that silence, other errors surfaced. I realized I had been drifting for a long time.
        Navigating life requires a map, or at least a compass. Growing up, I lacked a certain architectural guidance—a blueprint on "how to be a man" that most people seem to inherit naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
        Without that blueprint, and with the trauma compounding, I felt lost. 
        I asked the ceiling: <em>"What is my purpose?"</em>
        The ceiling gave no answer. I was building a structure on unstable ground, and when the earthquake hit in 2022, it all collapsed. I felt small. I felt like I was drifting in deep space without a tether.
    </p>

    <h2>0x03. SIGNAL RESTORED (2025)</h2>
    <p>
        Then, a glitch in the void. 2025.
        By sheer coincidence—or perhaps divine intervention—I crossed paths with an old friend from high school. One connection led to another, and suddenly, I was at a reunion.
    </p>
    <p>
        I met <em>Him</em> again.
        It felt like God finally answered a prayer I had stopped saying out loud. That reunion was the only high-bandwidth signal in three years of noise. 
        For a few hours, the fog lifted. I realized that despite my isolation, the network was still there. People still remembered me.
    </p>

    <h2>0x04. LATENCY & REGRET</h2>
    <p>
        But connection brings clarity, and clarity hurts.
        Seeing everyone moving forward made me realize how far back I had fallen.
        To the friends who tried to reach out, and to the three of you specifically: <strong>I am sorry.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        I didn't ghost you because I was arrogant. I withdrew because I was ashamed.
        I looked at your progress, and then I looked at my own stagnation. I felt like a "Lesser Man." I felt unworthy of standing on the same stage as you.
        I told myself, <em>"I'll reply when I'm fixed. I'll meet them when I'm successful."</em>
        But "fixed" never came. The gap just got wider. I let my insecurity cost me years of brotherhood, and that is a debt I am still trying to calculate.
    </p>

    <h2>0x05. EXECUTE REBOOT</h2>
    <p>
        But we cannot edit the logs of the past. We can only write new entries.
        Today, I stop waiting to be "fixed." I am starting the repair process myself.
    </p>
    <p>
        This website is the first output. It is small, less than 4KB, but it proves that the system is running again.
        I am rebuilding the foundations—physically, mentally, and spiritually. 
        I am reclaiming the discipline I lost.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will fix this. Not with a magic patch, but brick by brick. Rep by rep. Line by line.
        It will be slow. It will be painful. But I am no longer frozen.
    </p>
    
    <p style="margin-top:2rem; font-style:italic; opacity: 0.8;">
        (If you are reading this: I miss you, bro.)
    </p>
    
    <p style="margin-top:0.5rem; font-weight:bold;">
        We're all gonna make it.
