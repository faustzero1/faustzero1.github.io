    <h1>THE BURDEN OF BEING AWAKE</h1>
    <p class="cm">Date: 2026-01-21 | Category: Philosophy</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>0x01. THE UNQUIET MIND</h2>
    <p>
        I often wonder why we cannot simply <em>be</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Look at a stone in a riverbed. It sits there, enduring the current, perfectly content in its stillness. Look at a predator in the wild. It hunts, it feeds, it sleeps. It doesn't stare at the moon and ask why it hangs there. It is at peace because it is complete.
    </p>
    <p>
        But we are not. We are the only species that looks up at the stars and feels a terrifying ache to understand them.
        Curiosity is not just a trait; it is a restlessness woven into our biology. It is a refusal to accept the world at face value. If we were merely animals designed for survival, we would have stayed in the warm safety of the cave. But something inside us refuses to sit in the dark. We are compelled to peel back the layers of reality, even when the answers frighten us.
    </p>

    <h2>0x02. THE ABILITY TO SAY "NO"</h2>
    <p>
        Then there is the matter of intellect. It is a heavy crown to wear.
        Many think intelligence is just about solving problems or storing information. I disagree. I think true intellect is the <strong>Power of Veto</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every other creature is a slave to its immediate needs. Hunger commands them, and they eat. Fear strikes them, and they run. They flow with the stream of their instincts.
        But humans? We possess the terrifying freedom to look at our own impulses—our lethargy, our anger, our desire for comfort—and simply say: <em>"No."</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        We are the only creatures capable of trading present pleasure for future strength. We can choose to suffer now so we can be better later. That ability to override our own biological default is what makes us human. It is our only weapon against chaos.
    </p>

    <h2>0x03. THE BRIDGE</h2>
    <p>
        Are we alone in this? On this earth, I believe we are.
        The old philosophers used to say we exist in the "Middle State."
        Below us are the beasts, governed by instinct, unaware but happy. Above us are the divine, governed by pure reason, perfect and static.
    </p>
    <p>
        And then there is us. The bridge.
        We are a strange architecture—built from the dust of the earth, perishable and hungry, yet filled with a mind that demands the infinite. This is why life feels like a struggle. We are constantly torn between the gravity of the mud and the pull of the sky. 
        When we let our discipline slip, we sink. When we sharpen our minds and master our bodies, we ascend.
    </p>

    <h2>0x04. CONSTRUCTION</h2>
    <p>
        So, what is the point of it all?
        I used to look for a map. I used to wait for a sign to tell me my purpose.
        But I’ve come to realize that purpose isn't something you find lying on the ground. It is something you <strong>build</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We were given this curiosity to seek the truth. We were given this intellect to master ourselves. We were given this body to forge a vessel capable of carrying it all.
        The goal is not to reach a destination, but to refine the traveler. To refuse mediocrity. To chisel away the parts of ourselves that are weak or untrue, day by day, until what remains is undeniable.
    </p>
    
    <p style="margin-top:2rem; font-style:italic; opacity: 0.8;">
        We are here to witness the universe, and in doing so, witness ourselves.
    </p>
    
    <p style="margin-top:0.5rem; font-weight:bold;">
       Walk again~
